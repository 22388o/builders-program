## Project Details

In this section, please submit the following (where applicable):

* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Wireframes of the UI
* API specifications of the product
* Documentation of core components, architecture etc. to be deployed
* Details of a PoC / MVP that has been done previously

## Ecosystem

Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different? Does your team already have some partnerships established? Can you share more details about these colllaborations?

## Development Roadmap

Please break your development roadmap into a number of milestones and include instructions / information on how we can verify that these are the expected deliverables. When a milestone is being delivered, we will refer back to this contract to test that these functionalities exist in your product. An **example roadmap** is provided below.

For each milestone:

* include a specification of your software. There must be enough details to verify that the software meets the specification.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> If any of your deliverables are based on somebody else's work, please ensure that it is publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective projects. You need to **highlight this in your milestone documentation and in the source code** where applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules

* **Estimated duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  2

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.) |
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be implemented for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features

...

### Community engagement

Upon successful delivery of all milestones, it would be great if you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on [Medium](https://medium.com/)). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. For larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

## Future Plans

Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

## Additional Information
