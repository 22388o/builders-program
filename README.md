# Acceleration Program for Plasm and Shiden Network

insert community designed banner image of the program

## Introduction

Our Acceleration Program was created to help further the development, growth and adoption of Plasm Network and Shiden Network by supporting teams who are building on our ecosystem. The program is operated by Stake Technologies with guidance from Parity Technologies under the [Builders for Builders initiative](https://www.parity.io/substrate-builders-program-update-builders-for-builders/).

## Who and what are we looking for?

Unlike other acceleration programs, our program is **idea agnostic**. Our focus has always been on the community and product development and we have designed the program as such - we are interested in **high quality teams** that are building **applications that the community wants**.

This can be broadly split into 2 different tracks, the ecosystem track and the innovation track.

### Ecosystem Track

As the name suggests, the ecosystem track is an umbrella term to categorise any applications or services that can help improve the adoption of the ecosystem. Some common examples include:

- dApps (dexes, lending platforms, mixers, insurance)
- developer tools (libraries, pallets, debugging tools)
- infrastructure (custodians, bridges, oracles, analytics)
- integration grants (port over and maintain dapps from other blockchains)

### Innovation Track

The innovation track is focused primarily on research and theory. Some examples of what falls under the innovation track could be code obfuscation, cryptography, reputation systems or even unique dapp ideas.

## Why should I apply for your Acceleration Program?

We understand that any talented teams will have no problems applying to other acceleration programs so aside from your typical financial support, we will also provide the following:

### Technical support

- During the onboarding phase, one of our core devs will walk your team through on how to develop and maintain applications / infrastructures on Plasm / Shiden Network.
- We will set up an exclusive discord group between your team and our core devs for you to ask any questions.
- If you are still unable to resolve these issues, we can arrange for ad-hoc meetings with the core team to solve these technical problems.
- We can also provide preliminary code reviews prior to your milestone submission.

### Network and Fundraising support

- We have access to a huge network of traditional / crypto investors, industry experts, blockchain mentors, exchanges, marketmakers etc. all of which we can link you up with to elevate your project to the next level.
- A very unique feature of the Plasm / Shiden Network is [DApps staking](https://docs.plasmnet.io/build/dapps-reward) where developers can earn PLM / SDN tokens by developing and deploying applications. These tokens can provide additional supplementary income for your team. **The better the performance of your dapp (determined by how many tokens are delegated to you), the more tokens you will receive from each block.**

### Marketing support

- We can help to promote your project on our various social media platforms like Twitter, Telegram etc.
- You will also be invited to our community meetups and conferences as a guest speaker to share more about your project and to grow your community.
- We are a big fan of cross collaboration between projects in the ecosystem and will help to connect your team with other projects in the Acceleration Program to create something amazing.

### Post graduation support

- It's hard to get into our Acceleration Program, even harder to graduate from it so if you made it through the entire process, congratulations! As a final gift from us, should you ever need help for your future projects, feel free to reach out to us and we will try our best to help you.

## Why build on Plasm Network & Shiden Network?

Aside from the Acceleration Program, there are 4 more compelling reasons why you would build here instead of other smart contract enabled parachains.

1. X-VM (cross virtual machine) interoperability

    It doesn't matter where your contracts are deployed, be it the EVM, the OVM or even WASM, as long as it's on Plasm / Shiden network, all contracts can interact with each other!

2. Full Ethereum compatibility

    We support all major Ethereum development tools like metamask, remix, truffle, hardhat etc. Deploying contracts on Plasm / Shiden is as simple as changing the rpc url!

3. Dapps staking

    As mentioneded [previously](#network-and-fundraising-support), dapps staking is a unique feature of Plasm / Shiden Network. There are no other parachains where you can get paid for deploying contracts onto the blockchain!

4. Scalable from the get-go

    If your application requires a much higher throughput, you can easily take advantage of one of the natively supported layer 2 modules like Plasma, OVM or ZK rollups!

## How to apply?

- On our [forum](https://forum.plasmnet.io/c/acceleration-program/14), create a thread titled "name of your project's application proposal"
- We recommend taking reference to [W3F's general grant proposal template](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/grant_application_template.md) when making your application post. If you have any privacy concerns, please reach out to us directly instead.

## FAQs

### What is Builders for Builders program?

> Builders for Builders is a new initiative that aims to empower teams building Substrate-based parachains to develop and grow their own ecosystem of builders developing on top of their parachain. As part of the Builders for Builders initiative, the Substrate Builders Program team will share best practices gained from running the SBP for over a year now to help parachain teams build their own similar programs for teams building solutions on top of their parachain. These programs, called Parachain Builders Programs (PBP) will allow parachain teams to become mentors to others and develop their own thriving community of builders, enriching the Polkadot ecosystem as a whole.

### When will the Acceleration Program commence and how long will it run for?

The Acceleration Programs for both Plasm Network and Shiden Network will go live soon after winning their respective parachain auctions i.e. Polkadot for Plasm and Kusama for Shiden.

### What is the difference between Plasm Network and Shiden Network?

Shiden is to Plasm what Kusama is to Polkadot. Shiden is our canary network.

### Is this Acceleration Program for Plasm Network or Shiden Network?

The acceleration program is for both but it will start with Shiden Network first. Once we win the Kusama parachain auction, we will go live with Acceleration Program for Shiden Network. Once we win the Polkadot parachain auction, we will go live with the Acceleration Program for Plasm Network.

### Are there any application fees?

No.


### What is the application process like?

#### 1. Application

[Apply here](#how-to-apply)

#### 2. Assessment

An informal call will be scheduled between your team and the Acceleration Program committee. The purpose of this call is to get to know your team better, your motivations etc.

#### 3. Evaluation

The Acceleration Program committee will evaluate your application based on the following factors:

- your proposal
- your informal chat with us
- your interactions with the commmunity
- the community's sentiments towards your team and idea.

#### 4. Feedback and Decision

Once the Acceleration Program committee reaches a majority agreement, we will relay our feedback and decision to your team via the forum. Note that our decisions are not set in stone i.e. if there is overwhelming support from the community for your project, we will reconsider our decision.

#### 5. Onboarding

Successful applicants will be onboarded to the program as [shared earlier](#technical-support).

### How long will it take before I hear back from you?

You should hear back from us within a few days of posting on the forum.

### Who is in the Acceleration Program Committee?

The Acceleration Program currently consists of 8 members, 4 from the Plasm team and 4 ambassadors from our community. These 8 individuals will pull together their unique skillset and experiences to perform a comprehensive evaluation of your application. Note that if a consensus cannot be reached, the default behaviour is to reject the application.

### What makes a good application?

- A well thought out proposal.
- Positive interaction on the forum with our community.
- A technically capable team that is transparent and ambitious.
- Your team has the community's best interest at heart.

### Will grants be given out in the program?

Yes. Prior to commencing any work, we (you and the Acceleration Program committee) have to come to an agreement as to how much will be disbursed upon delivering on the milestones. There should be a detailed breakdown of this in your proposal.

### How much grants can I apply for?

There is no hardcap per se so you need to approximate accordingly to how much you are willing to work for. We will not take advantage of you but do not expect us to agree to a 1m USD proposal for minimal changes.
