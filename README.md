# Acceleration Program for Plasm Network and Shiden Network

insert community designed banner image of the program

## Introduction

Our Acceleration Program was created to help further the development, growth and adoption of Plasm Network and Shiden Network by supporting teams who are building on our ecosystem. The program is operated by Stake Technologies with guidance from Parity Technologies under the [Builders for Builders initiative](https://www.parity.io/substrate-builders-program-update-builders-for-builders/).

## Who and what are we looking for?

Unlike other acceleration programs, our program is **idea agnostic**. Our focus has always been on the community and product development and we have designed the program as such - we are interested in **high quality teams** that are building **applications that the community wants**.

This can be broadly split into 2 different tracks, the ecosystem track and the innovation track.

### Ecosystem Track

As the name suggests, the ecosystem track is an umbrella term to categorise any applications or services that can help improve the adoption of the ecosystem. Some common examples include:

- dApps (dexes, lending platforms, mixers, insurance)
- developer tools (libraries, pallets, debugging tools)
- infrastructure (custodians, bridges, oracles, analytics)
- integration grants (port over and maintain dapps from other blockchains)

### Innovation Track

The innovation track is focused primarily on research and theory. Some examples of what falls under the innovation track could be code obfuscation, cryptography, reputation systems or even unique dapp ideas. 

## Why should I apply?

We understand that any talented teams will have no problems applying to other programs so aside from your typical financial support, we will also provide the following:

### Technical support

- During the onboarding phase, one of our core devs will walk your team through on how to develop and maintain applications/infrastructures on the Shiden Network.
- We will set up an exclusive discord group between your team and our core devs for you to ask any questions.
- If you are still unable to resolve these issues, we can arrange for ad-hoc meetings with the core team to solve these technical problems.
- Preliminary security audits will also be provided for teams who are building DApps.

### Network and Fundraising support

- We have access to a huge network of traditional / crypto investors, industry experts, blockchain mentors, exchanges, VCs, marketmakers etc. all of which we can link you up with to elevate your project to the next level.
- A very unique feature of the Shiden Network is [DApps staking](https://docs.plasmnet.io/build/dapps-reward) where developers can earn SDN tokens by developing and deploying applications on the Shiden. These additional SDN tokens can help to supplement your team's income.
### Marketing support

- As the saying goes "You can have the best product in the world, but if nobody knows about it, what good is it?" so part of what we can also do is to help promote your project on the various social media platforms like Twitter, Telegram etc.
- You will also be invited to our community meetups and conferences as a guest speaker to share more about your project and to grow your community.
- We are a big fan of cross collaboration between projects in the ecosystem and will help to link your team with other projects in the acceleration program to create something amazing.

### Post graduation support

- It's hard to get into the Shiden Network Acceleration Program, even harder to graduate from it so if you made it through the entire process, congratulations! As a final gift from us to you, should you ever need help for your future projects, feel free to reach out to us and we will try our best to help you.

## FAQs

### What is Builders for Builders program?

> Builders for Builders is a new initiative that aims to empower teams building Substrate-based parachains to develop and grow their own ecosystem of builders developing on top of their parachain. As part of the Builders for Builders initiative, the Substrate Builders Program team will share best practices gained from running the SBP for over a year now to help parachain teams build their own similar programs for teams building solutions on top of their parachain. These programs, called Parachain Builders Programs (PBP) will allow parachain teams to become mentors to others and develop their own thriving community of builders, enriching the Polkadot ecosystem as a whole.
